# jpeg_cod.m & jpeg_decod.m

### Description

Matlab files that, respectively, codify a black and white image (with only luminance components) into a binary file, and decodify a sequence of symbols generated by the first code.
It is used the baseline encoder of JPEG.
The decodification file still only receives the sequence of symbols, that is converted into a sequence of bits, not the final binary file.

# huffmanCodexAndDecodex.cpp

### Description

CPP file that receives as input a phrase and converts it into a sequence of bits by huffman codification, besides of process the decodification of this sequence. 
There is not a actual output in this code, but it contains a algorithm to codify a phrase using huffman and decodify it using the code words generated.
